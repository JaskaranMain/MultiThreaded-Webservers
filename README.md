# MultiThreaded-Webservers:
A multithreaded web server implementation in Java for handling concurrent HTTP requests.

## Description

This project aims to provide a simple yet efficient solution for serving web content concurrently to multiple clients. The server utilizes multithreading to handle incoming HTTP requests, allowing for improved scalability and responsiveness.

## Usage

Once the server is running, it will listen for incoming HTTP requests on the specified port. You can access the server's content by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:<port>/`.

## Features

- Multithreaded architecture for handling concurrent connections
- Support for basic HTTP methods (GET, POST)
- Configurable server settings (port number, maximum number of threads, etc.)
